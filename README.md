# Repository Description
This repository features a C++ tour booking system project, designed to illustrate the implementation and application of fundamental data structures and concepts of the language in a real-world scenario.
# Program File Description
The programs contained within this repository are individual implementations of various C++ data structures and concepts.
### Program#01 - Linear Search
This Program Implements Linear search, a sequential element-by-element data search concept of c++ in a basic tour booking system which manages tour details and bookings. The system demonstrates object-oriented principles such as encapsulation, abstraction, classes and objects, data hiding, modularization, etc and also provides the functionality to add and search tours by destination or ID.
### Program#02 - Singly Linked List
This C++ program implements a tour management system using a singly linked list (SLL). It demonstrates the concept of linked lists in C++, allowing users to perform various operations. The system utilizes a Node structure and an SLL class, showcasing object-oriented principles like encapsulation and data abstraction. Functionality includes inserting, displaying, deleting, searching, and counting tour details, providing a comprehensive tour management interface.
### Program#03 - Doubly Linked list
This C++ program implements a tour management system using a doubly linked list (DLL). It demonstrates the concept of doubly linked lists, where each node has pointers to both the next and previous nodes, enabling bidirectional traversal. The system utilizes a Node structure and a DLL class, showcasing object-oriented principles such as encapsulation and data abstraction. Functionality includes inserting, displaying, searching, deleting, and counting tour details. Users can perform operations at the beginning, end, or specific positions, as well as search and delete by tour ID, providing a robust tour management interface.
### Program#04 -
