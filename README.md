# Repository Description
This repository features a C++ tour booking system project, designed to illustrate the implementation and application of fundamental data structures and concepts of the language in a real-world scenario.
# Program File Description
The programs contained within this repository are individual implementations of various C++ data structures and concepts.
### Program#01 - Linear Search
This Program Implements Linear search, a sequential element-by-element data search concept of c++ in a basic tour booking system which manages tour details and bookings. The system demonstrates object-oriented principles such as encapsulation, abstraction, classes and objects, data hiding, modularization, etc and also provides the functionality to add and search tours by destination or ID.
### Program#02 - Singly Linked List
This C++ program implements a tour management system using a singly linked list (SLL). It demonstrates the concept of linked lists in C++, allowing users to perform various operations. The system utilizes a Node structure and an SLL class, showcasing object-oriented principles like encapsulation and data abstraction. Functionality includes inserting, displaying, deleting, searching, and counting tour details, providing a comprehensive tour management interface.
