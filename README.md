### Program#01 - Linear Search
This Program Implements Linear search, a sequential element-by-element data search concept of c++ in a basic tour booking system which manages tour details and bookings. The system demonstrates object-oriented principles such as encapsulation, abstraction, classes and objects, data hiding, modularization, etc and also provides the functionality to add and search tours by destination or ID.
