# Repository Description
This repository features a C++ tour booking system project, designed to illustrate the implementation and application of fundamental data structures and concepts of the language in a real-world scenario.
# Program File Description
The programs contained within this repository are individual implementations of various C++ data structures and concepts.
### Program#01 - Linear Search
This Program Implements Linear search, a sequential element-by-element data search concept of c++ in a basic tour booking system which manages tour details and bookings. The system demonstrates object-oriented principles such as encapsulation, abstraction, classes and objects, data hiding, modularization, etc and also provides the functionality to add and search tours by destination or ID.
### Program#02 - Singly Linked List
This C++ program implements a tour management system using a singly linked list (SLL). It demonstrates the concept of linked lists in C++, allowing users to perform various operations. The system utilizes a Node structure and an SLL class, showcasing object-oriented principles like encapsulation and data abstraction. Functionality includes inserting, displaying, deleting, searching, and counting tour details, providing a comprehensive tour management interface.
### Program#03 - Doubly Linked list
This C++ program implements a tour management system using a doubly linked list (DLL). It demonstrates the concept of doubly linked lists, where each node has pointers to both the next and previous nodes, enabling bidirectional traversal. The system utilizes a Node structure and a DLL class, showcasing object-oriented principles such as encapsulation and data abstraction. Functionality includes inserting, displaying, searching, deleting, and counting tour details. Users can perform operations at the beginning, end, or specific positions, as well as search and delete by tour ID, providing a robust tour management interface.
### Program#04 - Stacks
This C++ program simulates a tour booking system using a stack. It allows users to add, remove, view, search, and update tour bookings. The Stack class manages tour information, including ID, origin, destination, passenger details, and price. It calculates prices based on destination and age, and provides error handling for stack operations and invalid inputs. The main function presents a menu-driven interface for user interaction with the stack.
### Program#05 - Queues
This C++ program models a tour booking system, leveraging a queue for FIFO booking management. Each booking encapsulates tour ID, origin, destination, passenger details, and a dynamically calculated price. A key feature is the search functionality, which employs a binary search algorithm for rapid Tour ID retrieval. To enable this, the queue is sorted by Tour ID prior to the search, significantly enhancing performance compared to a linear search. The system also facilitates comprehensive booking updates.
### Program#06 - Binary Search
This C++ program simulates a tour booking system using a queue data structure. It manages tour information, including ID, origin, destination, passenger details, and price, with calculations based on destination and age. The Queue class provides functionalities to add, remove, view, search, and update tour bookings, adhering to the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. The main function offers a menu-driven interface, allowing users to interact with the queue, handle errors, and exit the system.
### Program#07 - Buuble Sort & Selection Sort
